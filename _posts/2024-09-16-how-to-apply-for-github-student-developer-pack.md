## Introduction

The GitHub Student Developer Pack is a valuable resource offering students access to premium development tools and services for free or at a discounted rate. However, before you can apply, there are certain prerequisites that you must meet, including setting up billing details and enabling Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) on your GitHub account. This guide will walk you through the application process, ensuring you're prepared with all necessary details.

## Prerequisites: Billing Details and 2FA Setup

### **1. Add Billing Details**

GitHub requires you to have a valid Address linked to your account before applying for the Student Developer Pack, even if the pack offers free services. Make sure you have set up billing details:

1. Navigate to [Billing Settings](https://github.com/settings/billing).
2. Add a valid Address which is in your College ID.
3. Save your billing information.

### **2. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**

Enabling Two-Factor Authentication adds an extra layer of security to your GitHub account. You cannot apply for the Student Developer Pack without 2FA enabled:

1. Go to [GitHub Security Settings](https://github.com/settings/security).
2. Click **Enable Two-Factor Authentication**.
3. Set it up using either a mobile app (like Google Authenticator) or via SMS.
4. Save the backup codes in case you lose access to your 2FA device.

**Without completing these steps, you will not be able to proceed with the application for the GitHub Student Developer Pack.**
